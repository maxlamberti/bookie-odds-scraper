      "Only Real Money Wagering: Betting on skins is a fun way to get in on the action, but real fans know the danger. Skins are unregulated, volatile, and difficult to liquidate. By the time you get any real cash in your hand, you’ve lost a ton of time and value. Real money wagering is by the far superior option.

      "#1) Watch Old Streams Before Wagering\n",
      "Want to know the key to beating the competition? Knowledge.\n",
      "Knowledge is power in the esports betting world. Before choosing a team, watch as much old footage of them as you possibly can. See how they fare with different maps, against different teams, and when the pressure is on. Let this inform your current bet. If you see that a team does well on a wide range of maps and can handle the spotlight, you’ve got a great chance of spotting an upset.\n",
      "#2) Read News and Opinion Articles\n",
      "We love helping gamers stay up to date with the latest news, but as the best csgo betting site, our main focus is helping esports bettors wager on their game of choice. All of the news published in our industry is a tool for helping you win more of your bets. Read our news, read blogs, read player’s stats, and watch their YouTube channels. Get as much info as you possibly can on players and experts before wagering.\n",
      "#3) Make Your Own Odds\n",
      "The odds you see on CS:GO gambling sites are a reflection of the general public’s opinion of the game. The line is adjusted so the book makes money. That’s why your expert opinion is your best weapon. The more you know about a game, the better you can adjust the real odds in your head. If a team is set at 2:1 to win a match and you know more than the general public, you might be able to gain a valuable edge. The odds might actually be closer to 1.6:1 and you’d be getting 2:1 on your money. It’s all about exploiting every edge you can find.\n",

      "Getting in on all of the adrenaline pumping action with some Counter Strike bets is the ultimate rush for any fan, but you have to make sure it’s with a site you can trust. We are sure you’ve heard horror stories in the past; we’ve heard them all.\n",
      "At Rivalry, we put an end to all that. Rivalry was made with safety and integrity in mind.\n",

      "There’s nothing like betting a few bucks on the games you’re already watching. It makes an already exciting game even more interesting. And if you're knowledgable, you can even make some money.\n",
      "You can watch your favorite teams via live streaming AND win some money doing it. Sounds like a good time right? We agree.\n",
      "As fans, we've been yearning for a safe place to bet on CS GO.\n",
      "Most sites didn’t have the right games or teams to choose from, and if they did, they were shady and untrustworthy. If they aren’t regulated, you never know if they are going to shut down and run away with your money.\n",

      "Only Real Money Wagering: Betting on skins is a fun way to get in on the action, but real fans know the danger. Skins are unregulated, volatile, and difficult to liquidate. By the time you get any real cash in your hand, you’ve lost a ton of time and value. Real money wagering is by the far superior option. The only thing lacking in terms of real money CS:GO is a safe platform to do it. Until now…\n",

All you have to do is prove you’re a real person (sorry, robots!).\n",
      "We Will Never Surprise You With Hidden Tricks: We hate gimmicks as much as the next gamer. We don’t do hidden tricks or bait and switch or anything else you’re used to on the web. We were tired of esportsbooks that promised big things and then surprised us with the fine print. No more of that here. We are totally transparent about everything we do.

      "#1) Watch Old Streams Before Wagering\n",
      "Want to know the key to beating the competition? Knowledge.\n",
      "Knowledge is power in the esports betting world. Before choosing a team, watch as much old footage of them as you possibly can. See how they fare with different maps, against different teams, and when the pressure is on. Let this inform your current bet. If you see that a team does well on a wide range of maps and can handle the spotlight, you’ve got a great chance of spotting an upset.\n",
      "#2) Read News and Opinion Articles\n",
      "We love helping gamers stay up to date with the latest news, but as the best csgo betting site, our main focus is helping esports bettors wager on their game of choice. All of the news published in our industry is a tool for helping you win more of your bets. Read our news, read blogs, read player’s stats, and watch their YouTube channels. Get as much info as you possibly can on players and experts before wagering.\n",
      "#3) Make Your Own Odds\n",
      "The odds you see on CS:GO gambling sites are a reflection of the general public’s opinion of the game. The line is adjusted so the book makes money. That’s why your expert opinion is your best weapon. The more you know about a game, the better you can adjust the real odds in your head. If a team is set at 2:1 to win a match and you know more than the general public, you might be able to gain a valuable edge. The odds might actually be closer to 1.6:1 and you’d be getting 2:1 on your money. It’s all about exploiting every edge you can find.\n",
